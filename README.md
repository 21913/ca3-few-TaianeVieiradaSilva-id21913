CA FRONT-END WEB 3 DEVELOPMENT

MY WEB SUMMARY

<br>
This project was designed as a summary of my curriculum and also of the skills acquired in the field of Front-End Web. With the help of tutor Erika Volodko it was possible to bring the combination of my current academic area and my passion for education.

Boostrap 5 and the W3 Schools website were used as a base. The colours used Blue, White, Gray and Black.
Blue represents competence, quality, calm, confidence, firmness, wisdom, loyalty, strength, productivity, confidence and security.
White is a colour commonly related to cleanliness, simplicity, innocence and purity. The different meanings of white colours can be included in a variety of website colour schemes. It is widely used on technology-related websites to portray simplicity. Gray is associated with formality, professionalism, sophistication, practicality, timelessness and strong character. It is great for professional websites, luxury goods, or to create a calming effect. And black works with the representation of feelings of power.

I believe that the site gave an air of clarity of ideas and sought to address simplicity, where less is more.

The idea of ​​Boostrap was interesting but it was necessary to add more items to stay the way it was planned.

The initial idea was to do everything with photos and texts in a column format, but the interaction was better, using information about me, my skills and experiences.
